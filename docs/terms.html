          <p>Welcome to Non App Store Apps Download. By downloading, cloning, or using the tools and resources provided in this repository (collectively, the "Tool"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the Tool.</p>

          <h2>1. Open-Source License</h2>
          <p>Non App Store Apps Download is released under the <a href="https://github.com/DJCastle/nonappstoreappsdownload/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT License</a>. Your use of the Tool is governed by the terms of that license. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the MIT License, the MIT License shall prevail for matters related to code usage, modification, and distribution.</p>

          <h2>2. What the Tool Does</h2>
          <p>The Tool is a native macOS AppleScript application (compiled with Apple's <code>osacompile</code>) that retrieves application installers directly from official third-party vendor servers. By using it, you acknowledge that the Tool will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Connect to the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew Cask API</a> to resolve the latest stable release URLs</li>
            <li>Download files from third-party vendor servers to your Desktop</li>
            <li>Make HTTP/HTTPS requests to vendor download URLs</li>
            <li>Request macOS system permissions (Desktop folder access, network access, file system access)</li>
            <li>Read and write to its own configuration file (<code>apps.txt</code>) inside the app bundle</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Tool does not install any applications. It only downloads the installer files (.dmg, .zip, .pkg) to your Desktop for you to install manually.</p>

          <h2>3. Third-Party Software</h2>
          <p>This Tool downloads applications from third-party vendors. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any third-party software downloaded by the Tool. Specifically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All application names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners</li>
            <li>Each downloaded application is governed by its own license agreement and terms of service</li>
            <li>We do not host, mirror, redistribute, or modify any third-party software</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for changes to third-party download URLs</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>By using this Tool, you agree to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Review the source code</strong> before running the Tool</li>
            <li><strong>Accept the license agreements</strong> of any software you download</li>
            <li><strong>Verify the integrity</strong> of downloaded files before installation</li>
            <li><strong>Comply with all applicable laws</strong> and software license terms</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Tool responsibly</strong> and only for lawful purposes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>The Tool is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
          <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Tool will be error-free or uninterrupted</li>
            <li>Download URLs will remain valid or accessible</li>
            <li>Third-party applications downloaded will function correctly</li>
            <li>The Tool will be compatible with all macOS versions or configurations</li>
            <li>Downloaded files will be free of defects or vulnerabilities</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Data loss or corruption resulting from downloaded software</li>
            <li>System instability caused by third-party applications</li>
            <li>Failed or corrupted downloads</li>
            <li>Any costs associated with system recovery or repair</li>
            <li>Loss of productivity or business interruption</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Homebrew Cask API</h2>
          <p>This Tool uses the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew Cask</a> public API to resolve download URLs for applications. Homebrew is an independent, community-maintained open-source project. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by the Homebrew project. The Homebrew Cask database is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BSD 2-Clause License</a>.</p>

          <h2>8. Code Signature Verification</h2>
          <p>macOS Gatekeeper will verify the code signature of downloaded applications before allowing them to run. We recommend keeping Gatekeeper enabled and only running applications from identified developers. The Tool does not bypass or disable any macOS security features.</p>

          <h2>9. Modifications to the Tool</h2>
          <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue any part of the Tool at any time without prior notice. We encourage you to monitor the repository's commit history for changes.</p>

          <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Your continued use of the Tool after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

          <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
