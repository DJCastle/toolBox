#  NON APP STORE APPS DOWNLOAD — App List
# ============================================================
#
#  ADDING APPS
#  -----------
#  The easiest way: click "Add App" when the app launches.
#  Type any app name (e.g. "Firefox") and pick from results.
#  Added apps are saved here automatically and persist
#  between sessions — your list stays even after closing
#  and reopening the app.
#
#  MANUAL EDITING
#  --------------
#  You can also edit this file directly.
#  Format:   App Name | filename.dmg | Download URL
#
#  DOWNLOAD URL OPTIONS
#  --------------------
#  You can use three types of download sources:
#
#  1. BREW:cask-name  (Recommended — always gets the latest stable release)
#     Uses the Homebrew Cask database to auto-resolve the latest
#     stable release URL. No beta versions, no need to track version numbers.
#     Find cask names at: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/
#     Example:  Firefox | Firefox.dmg | BREW:firefox
#
#  2. GITHUB:owner/repo
#     Auto-resolves the latest GitHub release (.dmg asset).
#     Example:  Rectangle | Rectangle.dmg | GITHUB:rxhanson/Rectangle
#
#  3. Direct URL (https://...)
#     A specific download link. You are responsible for keeping
#     this URL up to date when new versions are released.
#     Example:  MyApp | MyApp.dmg | https://example.com/MyApp.dmg
#
#  NOTES
#  -----
#  - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
#  - Blank lines are ignored
#  - Files are saved to your Desktop
#  - When using BREW:, the filename is auto-detected from the
#    resolved URL, so the filename column is just a fallback
#
#  ICLOUD SYNC TIP
#  ----------------
#  Save "Download Apps.app" to your iCloud Drive
#  (e.g. the Automator folder). Your app list syncs
#  across all your Macs automatically. After a system
#  reload, just open the app from iCloud — your full
#  list is ready to go.
#
#  HOW TO FIND THIS FILE
#  ---------------------
#  Right-click "Download Apps.app" > Show Package Contents
#  > Contents > Resources > apps.txt
#  Or click "Edit App List" when the app launches.
#
#  USE WITH CARE
#  -------------
#  This tool ONLY DOWNLOADS files to your Desktop. It does
#  not install, open, or run anything. You decide what to
#  do with the downloaded files.
#
#  When adding apps, make sure you know what you're selecting.
#  Search results may include similarly named apps — verify
#  the app name and developer before adding it to your list.
#  Only add software you recognize and trust.
#
#  SECURITY — USE OFFICIAL SOURCES ONLY
#  -------------------------------------
#  When editing this file manually, only use cask names from
#  the official Homebrew catalog: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/
#  Do not enter arbitrary text or untrusted values.
#
#  BREW: and GITHUB: sources are safe — they resolve to official
#  vendor URLs curated by the Homebrew community or pulled
#  directly from GitHub releases.
#
#  If using a direct URL, always get it from the app vendor's
#  official website. Never use third-party download sites,
#  mirrors, or unofficial sources. Unofficial downloads may
#  contain malware, adware, or tampered software.
#
#  How to find a safe direct download link:
#    1. Go to the app's official website
#    2. Find their download page
#    3. Right-click the download button > Copy Link Address
#    4. Paste that URL here
#
#  macOS Gatekeeper will verify code signatures before
#  allowing downloaded apps to run, but using official
#  sources is your first line of defense.
