# Automator Apps

Native macOS applications built with [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html) and compiled using Apple's `osacompile` into standard `.app` bundles. These use macOS native dialogs, progress bars, and system integration — no third-party frameworks required.
